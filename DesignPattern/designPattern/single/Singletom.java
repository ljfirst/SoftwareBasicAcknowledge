 * @description: HungrySinglePattern creates an instance object when
 * *the class is loaded, but there is no delay in loading.
 * *In order to solve this problem, LazySinglePattren is introduced,
 * *although the load can be delayed, but the thread is unsafe.
 * *In order to solve the thread security problem,
 * *the synchronized keyword is introduced.
 * *But there is a performance problem, more time-consuming,
 * *finally , the inner-class is a perfect solution.
 * *
 * *Attention:Experiments show that the double locks is faster
